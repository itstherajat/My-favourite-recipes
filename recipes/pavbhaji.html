    <h2>How to make Pav Bhaji</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Steps needed for making the dish</h3>
        <li>Boil the potatoes for 10 minutes until they are soft and mashable. Remove from flame and peel and mash the potatoes. Roughly chop or shred all the other vegetables in a pan with 2 cups of water and a little salt. Boil the veggies now. Once done, remove from flame and allow them to cool. Do not throw away the water as it has a lot of nutrition and can be used as the veg stock.</li>
        <li>Put a pan over medium flame and heat oil and 1 tablespoon butter together. Add cumin seeds in it and then add onions. Saute for a minute. Then, add 1 tsp garlic water to it (finely chopped garlic in 1 tbsp water). Now, add all the masala - coriander powder, deggi mirch, cumin powder, turmeric and salt to taste. Cook for a minute and then add tomato puree to it. Cook for a minute and then add mashed potatoes to it. Now, add the remaining veg stock of boiled veggies. Cook for 1-2 minutes and then add pav bhaji masala, kasoori methi, and coriander leaves. Stir well and then add 4 tbsp butter to the bhaji. Mix well and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes. Use a pav bhaji masher if possible to mash it further. Once done your bhaji is ready</li>
        <li>Now, put a pan over medium flame and roast pav in it. Once done, serve them with Bhaji. Garnish with some chopped onion and top the bhaji with some butter and coriander leaves.</li>
